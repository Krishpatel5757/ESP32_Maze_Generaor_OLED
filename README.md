# ESP32 Maze Generator on OLED

This project is a **random maze generator and player navigation game** developed using an **ESP32 microcontroller** and an **SSD1306 OLED display**. The maze is generated using the **Hunt and Kill algorithm**, and once generated, the player navigates from one end of the maze to the other using directional buttons.

After successfully reaching the goal, a new maze is automatically generated, creating an endless maze-solving experience.

## Features

- Randomly generated mazes on each run
- Maze generation using the **Hunt and Kill** algorithm
- Player block controlled via push buttons
- Goal-based movement from start to end of the maze
- Automatic regeneration of a new maze upon completion
- Manual reset using ESP32 reset button for fresh maze anytime

## Algorithm Used

The maze is generated using the **Hunt and Kill algorithm**, which:
- Randomly walks through the maze path
- Hunts for unvisited neighbors
- Backtracks to generate a complete and solvable maze
- Ensures that every cell is connected and reachable
